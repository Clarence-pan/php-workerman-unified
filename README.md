# About This

Workerman is awesome. But in some cases, we have to develop our APP on windows while actually running it in linux. 
We wanna use composer to manage our PHP packages. However workerman has two packages... It's painful to deploy.
So this library came out -- making a unified resolution to workerman and workerman-for-win.
